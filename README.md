#Rent-A-Car-GUI

This project runs a GUI that functions similarly to an app, which is intended to manage a fleet of cars and existing customers. Users can add, modify and delete customers and cars into the system. Once within the system, the user can rent out cars to a customer based on the desired vehicle type. These vehicle types are:
1. Luxury
2. Family
3. Economy
4. Commercial

The GUI also allows the functionalities of returning a vehicle from an existing customer and displaying a rented car report on each car in the system
